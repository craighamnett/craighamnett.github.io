# Realise

This is a proof of concept to redevelop the current site with the same existing functionality.

There are two purposes to this redevelopment:
 - Make the site as fast as possible.
 - Make the site flexible and extensible
 
Building the site in Jekyll will help to a certain extent, but will require careful planning and optimisations.

## Installation

Assuming you have [Ruby](http://rubyinstaller.org/) and [NodeJS](https://nodejs.org/en/)

 - Grab the repo
 - Install [Jekyll](http://jekyllrb.com/docs/installation/) - gem install jekyll
 - Open the config.yml file and ensure the url is correct for your development
 - run: jekyll build
