      <p>A friend recently asked for my thoughts on a digital product start-up he is working on. It is a great idea, in a receptive market, grounded in a strong business model. But something was missing from his elevator pitch.</p>

<p>I cannot share the details, but I can say that in addition to having a strong customer value proposition, I observed in his idea a broader social purpose; an educational element that helps kids become more creative. My thought was that this is a truly noble cause, which could help him to create something special that really connects with people, emotionally. His productâ€™s cause could help him win investment, employ the right talent, and ultimately win the hearts of consumers.</p>
